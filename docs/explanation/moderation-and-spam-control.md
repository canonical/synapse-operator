# Moderation and spam control

Moderation and spam control are critical to maintaining the health and security
of any communication platform, and Synapse is no exception. As a Matrix
homeserver, Synapse enables decentralized communication, which brings challenges
in combating abuse and ensuring user safety. This document
explores charm configurations and tools (Synapse Invite Checker Module and Mjolnir)
that can help set moderation and spam control in Synapse.
