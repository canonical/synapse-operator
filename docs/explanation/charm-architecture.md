# Charm architecture

Synapse is a drop in replacement for other chat servers like Mattermost and
Slack. It integrates with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as its
database.

The charm design leverages the [sidecar](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2015/06/the-distributed-system-toolkit-patterns/#example-1-sidecar-containers) pattern to allow multiple containers in each pod
with [Pebble](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/pebble) running as the workload
containerâ€™s entrypoint.

Pebble is a lightweight, API-driven process supervisor that is responsible for
configuring processes to run in a container and controlling those processes
throughout the workload lifecycle.

Pebble `services` are configured through [layers](https://github.com/canonical/pebble#layer-specification),
and the following containers represent each one a layer forming the effective
Pebble configuration, or `plan`:

1. An [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) container, which can be used to
efficiently serve static resources, as well as be the incoming point for all web
traffic to the pod.
2. The [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) container itself, which
has Synapse installed and configured.

As a result, if you run a `kubectl get pods` on a namespace named for the Juju
model you've deployed the Synapse charm into, you'll see something like the
following:

```bash
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
synapse-0                         3/3     Running   0         6h4m
```

This shows there are 3 containers - the two named above, as well as a container
for the charm code itself.

And if you run `kubectl describe pod synapse-0`, all the containers will have as
Command ```/charm/bin/pebble```. That's because Pebble is responsible for the
processes startup as explained above.

## OCI images

We use [Rockcraft](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/)
to build OCI Images for Synapse and NGINX.
The images are defined in [NGINX ROCK](https://github.com/canonical/synapse-operator/tree/main/nginx_rock/)
and [Synapse ROCK](https://github.com/canonical/synapse-operator/tree/main/synapse_rock).
They are published to [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/), the official repository
of charms.
This is done by publishing a resource to Charmhub as described in the
[Juju SDK How-to guides](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/publishing).

## Containers

Configuration files for the containers can be found in the respective
directories that define the ROCKs, see the section above.

### NGINX

This container is the entry point for all web traffic to the pod (on port
`8080`). Serves some static files directly and forwards non-static requests to
the Synapse container (on port `8008`).

The reason for that is since NGINX provides cache static content, reverse proxy,
and load balance among multiple application servers, as well as other features
it can be used in front of Synapse server to significantly reduce server and
network load.

The workload that this container is running is defined in the [NGINX ROCK](https://github.com/canonical/synapse-operator/tree/main/nginx_rock/).

### Synapse

Synapse is a Python application run by the script "/start.py".

Synapse listens by default in a no-TLS port `8008` serving it so NGINX can
forward non-static traffic to it.

The workload that this container is running is defined in the [Synapse ROCK](https://github.com/canonical/synapse-operator/tree/main/synapse_rock).

## Integrations

Please, see [Integrations](https://charmhub.io/synapse/docs/reference/integrations).

## Charm code overview

The `src/charm.py` is the default entry point for a charm and has the
SynapseOperatorCharm Python class which inherits from CharmBase.

CharmBase is the base class from which all Charms are formed, defined by [Ops](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/ops)
(Python framework for developing charms).

See more information in [Charm](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/constructs#heading--charm).

The `__init__` method guarantees that the charm observes all events relevant to
its operation and handles them.

Take, for example, when a configuration is changed by using the CLI.

1. User runs the command
```bash
juju config synapse server_name=myserver.myserver.com
```
2. A `config-changed` event is emitted
3. In the `__init__` method is defined how to handle this event like this:
```python
self.framework.observe(self.on.config_changed, self._on_config_changed)
```
4. The method `_on_config_changed`, for its turn,  will take the necessary
actions such as waiting for all the relations to be ready and then configuring
the containers.
