# Synapse Operator

A Juju charm deploying and managing [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) on Kubernetes.
Synapse is a drop in replacement for other chat servers like Mattermost and
Slack.

This charm simplifies initial deployment and “day N” operations of Synapse on
Kubernetes, such as integration with SSO, access to S3 for redundant file
storage and more. It allows for deployment on many different Kubernetes
platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) to [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes)
to public cloud Kubernetes offerings.

As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own
Chat server whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the freedom to
deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Synapse simple and
straightforward through Juju’s clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
into multiple environments for testing of changes.
