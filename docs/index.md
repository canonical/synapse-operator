A Juju charm deploying and managing [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) on Kubernetes. Synapse is a drop in replacement for other chat servers like Mattermost and Slack.

This charm simplifies initial deployment and "day N" operations of Synapse on Kubernetes, such as integration with SSO, access to S3 for redundant file storage and more. It allows for deployment on
many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) to [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) to public cloud Kubernetes offerings.

As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own Chat server whilst keeping operations simple, and gives them the freedom to deploy on the Kubernetes platform of their choice.

For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Synapse simple and straightforward through Juju's clean interface. It will allow easy deployment into multiple environments for testing of changes.
