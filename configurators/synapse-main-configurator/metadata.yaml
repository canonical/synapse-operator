display-name: Synapse Main Configurator

summary: Configurator for Synapse server main application.

description: |
  This charm serves the main configuration needed to start a Synapse server.

  The charm lets you configure your Synapse server and provides this
  configuration over an interface, so that a Synapse charm can receive it via
  a relation.

  With a configurator charm, you can decouple configuration from the application
  code.

  This charm should be used next (in relation) to a Synapse charm.
